# (ARNO) Presentation of article and subject 
(https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo08.pdf)
  - Proof of Conecpt or Get the Fuck Out issue 8 - Deniable Backdoors Using Compiler Bugs.

  - Production quality compiler DO have bugs
  - Take advantage of miscompiling to build backdoors
  - GCC has 3.200 open bugs (june 2015)
  - Find a bug -> Find out how to exploit the bug -> Introduce patch that trips over the bug
  - Claiming to improve sudos debugging output
  - Inspection of the patched source code wont reveal the exploit

# Exploiting CLANG/LLVM to compile bad sudo
  - (SUNE) CLANG/LLVM
  - (SUNE) Introduce bug
  - (SUNE) DEMO: simple-bug.c
  - (JONATHAN) Explaining sudo
  - (JONATHAN) Describe exploit

# (ARNO) DEMO: sudo
  - Create user:              sudo useradd bob
  - Change user:              su bob; whoami
  - Who has sudo permissions: sudo less /etc/sudoers
  - Show groups:              groups
  - Shadow:                   cat /etc/shadow
  - Sudo shadow:              sudo cat /etc/shadow
  - Badsudo shadow:           ./sudo cat /etc/shadow

# (JONATHAN) Evaluating attack
  - Possible to implement in practice?
  - Recap on the preparations needed.
  - Forces and weaknesses
  - The trade-off: Deniability/unremarkability >< Specificity of effect.
